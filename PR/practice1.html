<p class="haha"> It was my first school trip since i have got to highschool.When I heard about the trip to The newly opened Ethiopian science museum i didn't hesitate to go. The trip was scheduled on Friday morning after we learn 3 periods. So after we learn the first three periods we started moving to the bus that was waiting outside of the school compound. As soon as all the students gathered the bus started moving and it was such a great joy to be in bus trip with all your classmates. We shouted,sang and did many things in the bus. We spent a great time in the bus although it was short time.</p>

<h3 class="haha">section 2</h3>
<p>When we reach the museum we passed through some security details by doing as we told by the police. The place was such an amazing place there were many product of technologies that we didn't even thought there were in this country. one of the assistor in the museum suggested us to take a look on some screen that displays a map of the our city. and it told us this is an application used by Ride.company and they showed us how they organize the drivers to give service to customers. after we saw that we went to see the Robot that was dressed up in traditional Ethiopian cloths(habesh kemis). we also saw other robots in the museum and many more displays on the screen that advertise different works and companies. The one thing that attracted me is the smart Home. it looks like a home but with much more technology and comfort. After we visited most of the things there we went to the top of the building where there was a good view of the city.and in there we started to take photos of the place and ourselves to keep memory. after such great journey we went back to the bus to go back to the school. we arrived in school around 9:15 and after taking some rest we all went to our home by remembering the day that we spent with our friends.

 <p id="here">Addis Ababa, 4 October 2022 (ECA) – As part of its digital transformation endeavor, the government of Ethiopia has inaugurated a new science museum in the capital city, Addis Ababa. The facility was inaugurated during the Pan-African Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2022 and acclaimed as progress towards envisioning the future of technology in Africa's digital transformation.
 
 The museum is built on a seven-hectare space hosting two major building complexes and several interactive exhibits that displayed local solutions in healthcare, finance, cybersecurity, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), service industries, data analytics, manufacturing, and robotics among others.
 
 In his remarks, Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, Abiy Ahmed, described the science museum as a ‘demonstration of Ethiopia's attention to science and technology’. He cited Ethiopia’s Digital Economy Strategy, which started implementation two years ago, as a testimony to Ethiopia’s commitment to the sector. He commended the Artificial Intelligence Institute as one of the governmental institutions undertaking initiatives to support the country’s digital transformation endeavor and praised its promising potential to provide problem-solving research. Mr. Ahmed also expressed hope that the museum will encourage young people to think creatively and utilize the space as a ‘breeding ground for innovative ideas’.</p></section>

 <p class="new">Mr. Antonio Pedro, Acting Executive Secretary for the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), reassured ECA's continued support to harness ethical AI and innovation for Africa's development. During the session, the need to continuously explore the contribution of artificial intelligence to Africa and the ‘kind of ethics we should follow’ when using the technology was raised.  Mr. Pedro highlighted the different digital technology transformation projects supported by the ECA towards harnessing the full potential of emerging technologies and sustaining economic development in the continent. Machine learning, big data and infrastructure development were cited as major opportunities for the ICT sector to flourish.</p>

 <p id="noone">The benefits of artificial intelligence notwithstanding, some scholars cautioned that care should be taken to avoid unintended and potentially harmful consequences in cases, for example, where artificial intelligence may not be used ethically and professionally. The need for African representation in the international artificial intelligence forum was also highlighted during the session.
 
 The newly inaugurated Science Museum is expected to further curate Ethiopia’s rich indigenous knowledge, science, and art alongside modern technological advancements. UNECA is committed to supporting the Science Museum through bilateral cooperation in artificial intelligence research, products development and services delivery that will enhance and impact the health, education, agriculture, transport sectors as well as public protection and safety with AI products and services.
 
 The inauguration ceremony also featured an exhibition of private technology startups and institutions showcasing some of the country’s home-grown solutions in healthcare, finance, cybersecurity, and service industries. The exhibition will be on display and open to the public for the next several weeks.</p>
